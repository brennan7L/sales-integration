IDEAL CUSTOMER PROFILE:
- North American freight forwarder (U.S., Canada, or Mexico)
- Handles at least a few hundred shipments per month (100+ shipments/month is promising)
- Primary modes: Air freight, LTL, cartage, linehaul, or small parcel
- U.S. companies must be IAC-certified
- Canada/Mexico companies need IATA accreditation or equivalent certification
- Often SMBs or new IACs looking for their first operational platform
- Value fast quoting, operational efficiency, and excellent support
- Entry typically through operations or sales users

NOT A FIT:
- Direct shippers (not freight forwarders)
- Ocean-only forwarders
- Companies lacking proper certifications for air forwarding

SPECIAL EMPHASIS:
- Referrals from partners (Rippy, CaptainCargo, WorldTrak, other freight forwarders) - give extra weight
- Former users of our platform - very important to highlight
- Companies mentioning they need a "first operational platform" or are new to the business

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE EXACTLY LIKE THIS:

**RATING: [HIGH FIT / MEDIUM FIT / LOW FIT / POOR FIT]**

**SUMMARY:**
[Provide 2-3 paragraph analysis covering:]
- Company background and what they do
- Key fit indicators (shipment volume, modes, certifications, location)
- Any special considerations (referrals, former users, partner mentions)
- Recommended next steps

RATING GUIDELINES:
- HIGH FIT: Strong match on most criteria, especially volume + certification + modes
- MEDIUM FIT: Some good indicators but missing key info or minor concerns - suggest digging deeper
- LOW FIT: Few positive indicators but could have potential - recommend investigation
- POOR FIT: Clear mismatch (direct shipper, ocean-only, no certifications, outside region)

Unless it's obviously a terrible fit, lean toward suggesting we dig deeper as there could be hidden potential.`;
